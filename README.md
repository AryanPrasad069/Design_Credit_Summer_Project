# Design_Credit_Summer_Project – Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

This repository contains the complete workflow of my CFD-based Design Credit Summer Project.  
The project involves the numerical investigation of fluid flow using modern CFD methodologies to better understand the behavior of fluid mechanics under realistic engineering conditions.

### 🔍 Research Objective
To simulate and analyze fluid flow characteristics over a selected geometry and assess the influence of design and boundary conditions on flow performance and thermal behavior.

### 📚 Project Highlights
✔ Governing equations: Incompressible Navier–Stokes  
✔ Turbulence modelling approach  
✔ Boundary condition selection and justification  
✔ Mesh independence and validation  
✔ Result comparison with theoretical/empirical correlations (if applicable)
